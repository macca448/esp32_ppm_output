# ESP32 PPM Output using Arduino Core V3.x.x

<br>

There is a number of sites that has this code but it's written for the ESP32 Timer API pre Espressif Arduino Core V3.x.x

<br>

This updated version compiles fine in the Arduino IDE V2.3.6 using Espressif Arduino Core V3.2.0

<br>

Will report back when hardware testing is complete
